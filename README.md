# SAW Chart

## _Standard Agile Website Chart_

_This chart is meant to assist in walking through a basic agile website project with a client_
_The idea is to visually illustrate the steps in completing the clients website, and the hours tied to each step_
_As each desired component is dragged into the active margin, a range of hours is created_
_The estimate can be saved, and viewed later in the admin area_
_This tool is an attempt to empower developers to not have to estimate projects, issues and stories, and allow clients to still have a total range of hours that might be invested in the project and an understanding as to how those hours will be spent_

## Demo

_http://powerful-taiga-2604.herokuapp.com/_

### _SAW chart is built with:_

- _Padrino Framework._
- _MongoDB (with Mongoid ODM)_
- _jquery and bootstrap_

## desired future

_Eventually all the components should be fully customizable_
_admins should be able to select which components to display and be able to add/remove components_
_drag and drop interface needs to be improved_
_an estimate should be editable at a later date_
_an estimate should be able to be integrated with and agile board, so components can translate directly to user stories_
